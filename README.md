## Workflow Automation Review

This documentation provides an overview of the workflow automation code. The workflow involves adding a new lead, updating the expected closed date, and moving the lead through different stages.

### Adding a New Lead

- Add a lead with a specific email and expected closed date.
- Convert the lead to a deal to activate the workflow.
- The pipeline stage starts at "New Lead."

### Moving Through Stages

- Moving the lead to the first stage triggers a new activity task and a Slack notification with an appointment link.
- Moving to the follow-up stage generates a new notification with an invalid link.
- Transitioning to the last stage results in a message in the general channel about the lead being closed.

### Email Notifications

An email is sent automatically thanking the user for subscription and requesting feedback.

### Workflow Mechanics

- The workflow is structured with stages like "New Lead" and "Follow-Up."
- Triggers include updating and adding deals or converting leads.
- Filters check for specific conditions before transitioning stages.

### Server-Side Configuration

The server-side configuration involves a dorker compose YAML file with ports and encryption settings.
